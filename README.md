## 🧑‍🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m **Shehroz Aziz** — a developer by profession, a thinker by nature, and a cosmic dreamer at heart.

My journey into tech started with a simple fascination: “How does this work?” That curiosity turned into a passion for building systems — from mobile apps and full-stack platforms to AI-infused features and IoT integrations. I explore how different technologies interact, scale, and impact real lives.

Beyond code, I’m deeply inspired by **astrophysics and cosmology**, which push me to think big, design better, and appreciate complexity. I believe great engineers don’t just solve problems — they ask better questions, stay curious, and never stop learning.
