## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm currently working on a **Cemetery Management System** called *Akhri Aramgah* that integrates smart technologies like **IoT** and **AI** to optimize cemetery operations. I'm also delving into **MERN stack** and **Android Studio** for my various projects, including a **Blood Bank Application** and an **Intrusion Detection System**.

I'm always exploring new technologies and learning how to make them work better, faster, and smarter. Whether it's front-end, back-end, or IoT development, I'm all in!
